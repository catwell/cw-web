# Disabling graphical password prompts
published 2014-10-24,updated 2015-08-31

These days Linux systems tend to open graphical password prompts when a CLI application needs user authentication. I don't know about you but I really don't like that.

The first offender is git, which uses x11-ssh-askpass if installed. The simplest solution would be not to install it but it is a dependency of virt-manager on Arch Linux... Thankfully you can tell git not to use it:

```
git config --global core.askpass ""

```

The second one, in my case, was pass [1]. If you try to use it in Gnome, the keyring hijacks the GPG agent and you get that message (plus a graphical prompt):

```
gpg: WARNING: The GNOME keyring manager hijacked the GnuPG agent.
gpg: WARNING: GnuPG will not work properly - please configure
that tool to not interfere with the GnuPG system!

```

The Gnome keyring is an annoying piece of software that replaces password prompts for several tools including SSH and GPG. you can disable it this way:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cd !$
cp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-* .
for i in *; do echo "Hidden=true" >> $i; done

```

... but then GPG will use yet another graphical prompt! To finally stay in your terminal, create the file `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` with the following content:

```
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses

```
