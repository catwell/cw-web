# FOSDEM 2025
published 2025-02-02

I am attending FOSDEM in Brussels for the 13th time physically. This is an event I anticipate every year, where I get to meet old friends and new people, watch interesting talks, and drink some Belgian beer.

This year I spent some time with Gawen [1], Denis [2], Hisham [3], my brother François, and a few other current and former colleagues.

Here is a list of talks I saw or intend to see (will be updated after the event):

* Open Cloud Mesh [4] — Michiel de Jong
* Why don't we have libsync yet? [5] — Victor Grishchenko
* Ladybird — a new independent browser written from scratch [6] — Jelle Raaijmakers
* Explore large image datasets with Panoptic [7] — Félix Alié, David Godicke & Edouard Bouté
* 14 Years of systemd [8] — Lennart Poettering
* Introduction to Serverless Workflow DSL [9] — Charles d'Avernas, Jean-Baptiste Bianchi & Ricardo Zanini Fernandes
* Porting LuaRocks to Teal: Exploring the Benefits of Statically Typed Code in Lua [10] — Victor Ilchev
* ZML: A High-Performance AI Inference Stack Built for Production and Multi-Accelerator Deployment [11] — Rene Schallner & Guillaume Wenzek
* History and advances of quantization in llama.cpp [12] — Tanya Dadasheva & Iwan Kawrakow
* What should Teal be? — musings on FOSS project directions [13] — Hisham Muhammad

I also sometimes use the opportunity to write a little code, this year I fiddled with aiomonitor and async generators in Python [14].
