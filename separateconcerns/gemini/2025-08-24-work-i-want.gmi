## I want to work on core product

This means I want to work directly on the product my employer is selling or something that makes it possible. Support functions matter and I have huge respect for them but they are not for me.

My sweet spot is working on B2B products and interacting directly with customers.

## I want to work on AI

Historically, my specialty is Distributed Systems, but I happened to work on AI (for Computer Vision) "before it was cool." I left the field, re-joined it, and I intend to stay in it [3] for now.

Note that for me working "on AI" does not just mean using LLMs through APIs. Typically, it means training and operating models.

## I want to work hybrid-remote in Paris

I believe close-knit teams that meet regularly learn to work better together. I know some people believe this can be achieved fully remotely but I do not. However, I also believe working from home part of the time has benefits including cutting down on commute and better focus.

This is not a hard red line, I could go with full remote or full in-office under some conditions. My location is though: my life is in Paris, France and I am not considering relocating anywhere.

## Fields I avoid / favor

I do not want to work in finance-related fields, including banking and crypto. I would also like to avoid working for HR / recruiting companies.

Fields that specifically interest me include energy and robotics.

## Management

I am highly autonomous and self-directed. All my direct managers so far have been the company founders. I can deal with some politics, but not much.

In most cases I prefer being an IC with a Staff+ [4] role. I am fine with having a few skilled IC reports; I do not manage managers.

## Culture

I recognize the necessity of process, but I highly dislike its abuse.

I think small teams with real ownership work best.

I think people who care [5] can — sometimes should — disagree and argue passionately, and still remain friends.
