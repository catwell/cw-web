# Tools
published 2020-03-01,updated 2023-05-01

A few days ago I read this article [1] which made me want to list some of the tools used at the four startups I have worked at so far.

I have mostly listed SaaS tools here, but you can also check out the ~stack tag on my Pinboard [2] for more.

I have also added a section at the end for some tools I use for my own projects.
