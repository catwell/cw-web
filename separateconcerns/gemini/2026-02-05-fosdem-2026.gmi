It's been that time of the year, again [1]. No Denis [2] and no Hisham [3] this time, but I still got to spend time with other FOSDEM regulars Gawen [4], Benoît [5], and Thijs [6]. I also met Corentin [7], Sylvain [8] and Mehdi [9], and got introduced to Hugo [10].

Here is a list of talks I saw:

* Evolving Git for the next decade [11] - Patrick Steinhardt
* Bringing up bare metal ExecuTorch on RISC-V [12] - 4 speakers
* WebNN and WebLLM on RISC-V with RVV and Tenstorrent [13] - Yuning Liang, Petr Penzin
* Messages: how a French government agency broke free of IMAP [14] - Sylvain Zimmer
* A practical introduction to the ET platform. [15] - Gianluca Guida
* Zero to matmul with the ET-SoC-1 [16] - Peter Cawley
* Zero-sysroot hermetic LLVM cross-compilation using Bazel [17] - Corentin Kerisit, David Zbarsky
* Crystal: A language for humans and computers [18] - Johannes Müller
* Building a minimal cross-platform terminal UI library [19] - Thijs Schreijer
* Relying on more transparent & trustworthy sources for Arch Linux packages [20] - Robin Candau
* Ty: Adventures of type-checking Python in Rust [21] - Shaygan Hooshyari
* Lightning lightning talks 2 [22]
* Open Source Security in spite of AI [23] - Daniel Stenberg

## A digression about agents

This year I didn't write the list above by hand. I gave the URLs to an agent [24] and the format I wanted and told it to make it. It's a detail, but I do things like this many times a day now.

I also had agents work for me over the FOSDEM weekend. They ported a personal web application I have from a Lua Web server [25] to another Lua Web server [26], from a CSS framework [27] to another CSS framework [28], and added end-to-end tests with Playwright [29]. Oh, and the application is in Teal [30] so they wrote the definition files for mote too. All I had to do was describe the task and nudge the agents in the right direction in between talks. If I did not have those agents, I would just never have done all this.

At work, I'm back to training models this week, after a long time working solely on inference. Going from zero to GPUs going brr with nontrivial things like adversarial learning and brand new, (almost) working experiment tracking [31] (because OpenAI is killing the old one [32]) took me roughly a day.

And that was with the old agents. I can't wait to see how well my new minions [33] do tomorrow.
