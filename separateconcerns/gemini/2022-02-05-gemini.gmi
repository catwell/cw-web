# Hello Gemini
published 2022-02-05


I have wanted to play with Gemini [1] for while now, so today being the first day of FOSDEM [2] I decided to do what I would have done if I was in Brussels and hack on something between two talks.

I ended up adding Gemini support to the static generator I use for this blog [3], which meant implementing a Gemini writer for Lunamark [4], plus a small trick to display links in the right place.

To host it, I went with Agate [5] which is a simple static content server; I will revisit this choice if I ever need dynamic content.

If you want to check it out, point a Gemini browser - I use Lagrange [6] - to separateconcerns.com [7].
