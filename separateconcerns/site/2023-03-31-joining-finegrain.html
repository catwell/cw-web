    <p>It&rsquo;s been a week since I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-03-11-leaving-inch.html">left Inch</a>, and now it is time to disclose what I am up to.</p>
<p>Last Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/pchapuis/status/1640254206148767745">I joined</a> a very early-stage startup called <a href="https://finegrain.ai">Finegrain</a>. We&rsquo;re working on improving online images using AI with no humans in the loop. The founders of the company are the <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html">Moodstocks</a> founders Denis and CÃ©dric, so we get to work together again after 10 years.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t hide it, I am not an AI specialist. Even though I keep informed on advances in the field, I have read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition">books</a> and written some deep learning code, I am far from the level required at a company like that.</p>
<p>I do intend to learn more, but it turns out we <strong>may</strong> also need the things I do have experience with, such as building scalable and resilient systems with few resources, designing simple APIs to do complex things, integrating with customers and more generally being a technical jack-of-all-trades at a small company :)</p>
<p>If <strong>you</strong> know about AI though, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finegrain-ai/jobs/">we are hiring</a>!</p>
