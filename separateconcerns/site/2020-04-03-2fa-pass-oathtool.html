    <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you don&rsquo;t want to depend on your phone to log into a website, and you wish <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org">your favorite password manager</a> would support 2FA. Well, it can.</p>
<p>When asked to setup 2FA on a website, get a text code for TOTP. If the website doesn&rsquo;t give you that option, just use <a href="http://zbar.sourceforge.net">zbar</a>. For instance, with the QR code from the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication">GitHub documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ zbarimg totp-click-enter-code.png
QR-Code:otpauth://totp/GitHub:LyaLya?secret=qmli3dwqm53vl7fy&amp;issuer=GitHub
scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.03 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Once you get the secret, put it in <code>2fa/github</code> in <code>pass</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, add this to your <code>.bashrc</code> (or the equivalent for whatever shell you use):</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">2fa () { oathtool --totp --base32 $(pass 2fa/"$1" | head -n 1) ; }
</code></pre>
<p>You can now get your 2FA codes like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ 2fa github
795864
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can get Bash completion with this simple script, that you must put in <code>/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/2fa</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">#/usr/bin/env bash

&gt;/dev/null pushd "${PASSWORD_STORE_DIR:-$HOME/.password-store}/2fa"
    l="$(find . -type f | sed s#^./## | sed s#.gpg\$##)"
&gt;/dev/null popd

complete -W "$l" 2fa
</code></pre>

<p>It was <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/abmkdz/2fa_2_factor_authentication_terminal_app">a post on Lobsters</a> that prompted me to post this. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/abmkdz/2fa_2_factor_authentication_terminal_app#c_c0y9io">Someone from the comments</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gawenr/status/1245973593453932544">a former colleague on Twitter</a> told me about <a href="https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp">a pass extension</a> I didn&rsquo;t know about which does almost the same thing.</p>
<p>Also, some people think that putting 2FA codes in a password manager defeats the purpose. But in practice TOTP 2FA does not really add much more to the security of my accounts than the strong random passwords I generate with pass. The &ldquo;second factor&rdquo; part isn&rsquo;t really the true benefit.</p>
<p>One actual advantage is that nobody on the network can sniff all of my credentials (like digest-based password verification methods). Another, and I think this is the main one, is that the owner of the website has chosen part of the credentials and hence ensured some degree of strength. What I do preserves both of those properties, so I&rsquo;m fine with it. By the way, note that password managers like <a href="https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/">1Password</a> and <a href="https://help.passbolt.com/configure/totp/time-based-one-time-password-mobile">Passbolt</a> do the same thing.</p>
<p>One thing you can do to improve the security of the whole thing is use 2FA <strong>to access pass</strong> by storing the GPG key in a Yubikey.</p>
