<h2>Goodbye Moodstocks</h2>

<p>Friday 20th will be my last day at Moodstocks. I am leaving a company where, after three years and a half, I was the most senior employee. As you may imagine, it was not an easy decision.</p>

<p>Moodstocks has grown up since I joined it. After several pivots, the founders have assembled a <a href="https://moodstocks.com/humans.txt">great team</a> I will miss, and together I dare say we have advanced the state of mobile image recognition. Recently, we have also been looking at other technologies related to mobile.</p>

<p>We have released two new products. The first one is what <a href="http://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html">was known as Physalis</a> and took the commercial name <a href="https://winch.io/">Winch</a>. This is what I have been mostly involved with for the last few months. I believe it has the potential to become the reference solution to write native mobile applications that react quickly and work offline.</p>

<p>The second product is <a href="http://overlay.ms/">Overlay</a>, a mobile application that lets you buy products from paper catalogs online. Years after Pikadeo and Notes, it is finally time for a real application available in the stores, leveraging Moodstocks&#39; <a href="https://moodstocks.com/">image recognition SDK</a> and Winch, showcasing the best of both technologies. But beyond pure tech, it is also a demonstration of Augmented Reality as we like it: fast, predictable, purposeful. No need for 3D models.</p>

<p>With those two products in the pipes, choosing to leave was incredibly difficult. But I did nevertheless, because of an opportunity I could not turn down.</p>

<h2>Hello Lima</h2>

<p>So, what next for me? After two weeks to see my family, eat too much and have some welcome rest, I <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cloud-guys/plug-the-brain-of-your-devices/posts/691351">will be joining</a> the team developing <a href="http://meetlima.com">the Lima</a> as a core developer.</p>

<p>The Lima, which promises no less than to solve the personal data storage problem, is the first hardware product I backed on Kickstarter. I was thinking: &quot;this won&#39;t be easy, but if those guys can do it, I want that device.&quot;</p>

<p>The Kickstarter went (very) well, so they started looking for help and got in touch. I was curious and decided to meet the founders. After a Saturday morning spent discussing the project at Starbucks, I was convinced: they are the right people to do this.</p>

<p>For years I have been convinced that ubiquitous computing is one of the next big things in technology and wanted to be part of it. As I see it, Lima gives me this opportunity today.</p>

So it looks like my short-term future holds some Unix development and a good dusting of my rusty C. I may try to sneak a Lua interpreter in that box at some point, but please don&#39;t tell the others! ;) Severin and Gawen have high expectations and I do not expect much relaxing but hey, it should be fun to live the adventure of Early Stage again.
