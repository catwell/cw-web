<p>Hisham just published an article about his personal <a href="http://hisham.hm/2014/01/02/how-to-write-lua-modules-in-a-post-module-world/">guidelines for writing Lua modules</a>. Interestingly, I do a lot of things differently. Let us see how.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Policy Bit #1: always require a module into a local named after the last component of the module’s full name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to do that, but not always. Exceptions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>modules with names that are too generic such as<code>path</code>, <code>utils</code> or <code>types</code> from Penlight, where I add an <code>x</code> at the end of the name (e.g. <code>pathx</code>);</li>
<li>modules which I use as alternatives for others, for instance <code>cjson</code> which I call <code>json</code>;</li>
<li>modules with names that are too long such as my own <code>multipart-post</code> which I call <code>mp</code> (it is not a valid identifier anyway, I would have to replace the dash by an underscore).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Policy Bit #2: start a module by declaring its table using the same all-lowercase local name that will be used to require it.</p>

<p>Policy Bit #3: Use local function to declare local functions only: that is, functions that won’t be accessible from outside the module.</p>

<p>Policy Bit #4: public functions are declared in the module table, with dot syntax.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do something entirely different. First, I <em>never</em> use the function sugar in Lua, so instead of writing <code>local function f()</code> I write <code>local f = function()</code>.</p>

<p>I also do not declare the module table at the top of the module, I return it at the end, listing public functions explicitly. That means public functions are declared as locals. Arguably, they could be confused with private functions but that doesn&#39;t bother me: if you are editing the code of the module, you probably know its interface. My public functions are also usually located at the end of the module.</p>

<p>To illustrate, Hisham&#39;s module example is:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local bar = {}

local function happy_greet(greeting)
   print(greeting .. &quot;!!!! :-D&quot;)
end

function bar.say(greeting)
   happy_greet(greeting)
end

return bar
</code></pre>

<p>I would write instead:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local happy_greet = function(greeting)
   print(greeting .. &quot;!!!! :-D&quot;)
end

local say = function(greeting)
  happy_greet(greeting)
end

return {
  say = say,
}
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage of doing this is that when you call a public function in the module itself it is a local. That means that you avoid a table lookup, but also that <em>it acts as a private function from the point of view of other functions in your module</em>.</p>

<p>To understand what I mean, imagine that we change our mind and now want to expose <code>happy_greet</code> as well.</p>

<p>Hisham&#39;s module becomes:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local bar = {}

function bar.happy_greet(greeting)
   print(greeting .. &quot;!!!! :-D&quot;)
end

function bar.say(greeting)
   bar.happy_greet(greeting)
end

return bar
</code></pre>

<p>Mine becomes:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local happy_greet = function(greeting)
   print(greeting .. &quot;!!!! :-D&quot;)
end

local say = function(greeting)
  happy_greet(greeting)
end

return {
  say = say,
  happy_greet = happy_greet,
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we can notice is that we had to modify <code>say</code> in Hisham&#39;s module and not in mine. But now imagine a &quot;malicious&quot; user does this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local bar = require &quot;bar&quot;

local fishy_greet = function(greeting)
  print(greeting .. &quot; &gt;&lt;&gt;&quot;)
end

bar.happy_greet = fishy_greet

bar.say(&quot;yay&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>With my module, the output would be <code>yay!!!! :-D</code>. With Hisham&#39;s, the output would be <code>yay &gt;&lt;&gt;</code>: the user is allowed to monkey patch their module in a way that has an effect on functions they do not explicitly touch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Policy Bit #5: construct a table for your class and name it LikeThis so we know your table is a class.</p>

<p>Policy Bit #6: functions that are supposed to be used as object methods should be clearly marked as such, and the colon syntax is a great way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, not how I do it :) Using CamelCase is a good idea but in the wild I see it more often for the actual module table, not for what Hisham calls the &quot;class&quot; table that is associated to <code>__index</code> in the metatable (I call it &quot;methods&quot;). Usually, it means (to me) that the constructor is <code>MyClass()</code>, whereas with a lowercase module name it would be <code>myclass.new()</code>. I use the latter and Penlight is an example of the former.</p>

<p>Just like I do not use the <code>function</code> sugar, I do not use the colon syntax to define functions. Moreover, <em>I often call methods with explicit self in the module itself</em>. Any idea why? Yeah, same as above, resistance to monkey patches. I agree that this is not a very convincing argument given that I often skip the little <code>local print = print</code> dance.</p>

<p>Other advantages include, again, less call overhead and the ability to call methods consistently on objects before they have their metatable. This is sometimes useful in constructors.</p>

<p>So where Hisham&#39;s class example is:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local myclass = {}

local MyClass = {}

function MyClass:some_method()
   -- code
end

function MyClass:another_one()
   self:some_method()
   -- more code
end

function myclass.new()
   local self = {}
   setmetatable(self, { __index = MyClass })
   return self
end

return myclass
</code></pre>

<p>I would write:</p>

<pre><code data-language="lua">local some_method = function(self)
  -- code
end

local another_one = function(self)
  some_method(self)
  -- more code
end

local methods = {
  some_method = some_method,
  another_one = another_one,
}

local new = function()
  return setmetatable({}, {__index = methods})
end

return {new = new}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course sometimes I do <em>not</em> want to resist monkey patches, and in that case I use colon syntax for calls, but never for definitions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Policy Bit #7: do not set any globals in your module and always return a table in the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one I cannot disagree with. It is the only rule that has an obvious externally visible effect. Do this or you will annoy all your users.</p>

I think this is what matters the most in the end: modules always return tables and never create globals. The rest is mostly implementation details!
