    <p>When I updated my Linux kernel to 5.11 I had the bad surprise to end up with a blinking underscore on reboot. It had been many years since an update had broken my system like that. I fixed it rather easily by booting in rescue mode and downgrading the kernel. I had no time to investigate so I just added <code>linux</code> to <code>IgnorePkg</code> at the time, But I don&rsquo;t use Arch to run old kernels so today I took the time to fix it &ldquo;properly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To do so, I reproduced the issue, then downgraded again and looked at the logs with <code>journalctl -b --boot=-1</code>. It quickly let me understand that it was GDM that was failing due to something wrong with graphics initialization.</p>
<p>To keep things short, let me skip to the conclusion: if you run into this issue on an old-ish Dell XPS with an Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics card like mine with GDM, Arch and Wayland (or something similar), try <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_mode_setting#Early_KMS_start">enabling early KMS</a> by adding <code>i915</code> to the <code>MODULES</code> array in <code>mkinitcpio.conf</code> and rebuilding the initramfs, that fixed it for me.</p>
