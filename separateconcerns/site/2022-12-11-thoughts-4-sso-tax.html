<h2 id="the-sso-tax">The SSO Tax</h2>

<p>I have had several discussions about how SSO should be priced by SaaS providers. On the one hand, making it prohibitively expensive weakens security for everyone, and there is <a href="https://sso.tax">a website about that</a>. On the other hand, features that distinguish between business categories are often related to security and compliance (audit logs, SLAs, etc).</p>

<p>My personal position - and I do not speak for anyone here including my employer - is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>not having any SSO for free plans is fine;</li>
<li>any paying customer should be able to use protocols such as OpenID Connect;</li>
<li>charging extra for SAML support is fair.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="amazon39s-distributed-computing-manifesto">Amazon&#39;s Distributed Computing Manifesto</h2>

<p>I often say SOA started to become mainstream when Jeff Bezos mandated it at Amazon around 2002, a story famously told by Steve Yegge. But Werner Vogels has <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/11/amazon-1998-distributed-computing-manifesto.html">shared a document</a> that shows the move began in 1998 and was advocated by engineers.</p>

<p>The Manifesto already emphasized moving data to the process, hiding data models from clients, data consistency issues... A fascinated read, almost 25 years later.</p>

<h2 id="fix-the-machine-not-the-person">Fix the machine, not the person</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nummi">This essay by Aaron Swartz</a> is ten years old. A good time to read it again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An organization is not just a pile of people, it’s also a set of structures. It’s almost like a machine made of men and women. [...] True, sometimes you have the wrong gears and need to replace them, but more often you’re just using them in the wrong way. When there’s a problem, you shouldn’t get angry with the gears — you should fix the machine. [...] You can’t force other people to change. You can, however, change just about everything else. And usually, that’s enough.</p>

<h2 id="journal-of-comprehensible-explanations">Journal of Comprehensible Explanations</h2>

<a href="https://third-bit.com/2022/11/20/journal-of-comprehensible-explanations/">Greg Wilson would like a journal of peer-reviewed summaries of research findings</a>. No new results, just good explanations. Me too!
