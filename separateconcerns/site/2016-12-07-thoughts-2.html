<h2 id="on-call">On Call</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss">Alice Goldfuss</a> started <a href="https://dbsmasher.com/2016/12/07/on-being-on-call/">a debate</a> about having developers on call. I am firmly in the camp of those who think it is a good thing, probably because I was a sysadmin before being a professional software engineer. But this means those developers must have the power to refuse to ship broken code that may make the pager go off as well.</p>

<p>In fact, it is all about fostering the sense of ownership, which is the N.1 trait I look for in developers. And this won&#39;t be the first time I have <a href="https://twitter.com/pchapuis/status/222690433308966913">quoted great people</a> <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-03-24-vogels-skills.html">saying similar things</a>!</p>

<h2 id="the-value-of-metrics">The value of metrics</h2>

<p>Here is something people who haven&#39;t worked in B2B software companies may not understand: sometimes knowing your product&#39;s metrics, how its users behave and the market it is operating in can be more valuable than the product itself. Small B2B2C software vendors often end up knowing things about their (huge) customers&#39; clients that the customers themselves don&#39;t.</p>

<p>What that means is: if you provide third-party software to your users, ask the third-party vendor what data points they collect, what they can do with them, and if they can feed them back to you. And if you are the third-party vendor, consider the value of that data, and maybe find clever ways to turn it into a competitive advantage.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-the-robot-do-that">Why did the robot do that?</h2>

<p><a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2016/12/why-did-the-robot-do-that.html">Explaining why AI makes decisions</a> is going to be very important in the years to come. Trusting algorithms is hard for humans. This slows down adoption and progress the most in areas that <a href="https://twitter.com/CalebWatney/status/747772853102084097">really</a> <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2015-11-06-e-voting.html">matter</a>. So we need a way to let concerned people &quot;feel&quot; why machines do things the way they do it. Because writing papers is nice, but we all know simply telling people to trust experts is never going to work. This means those topics are now <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2016-09-16-thoughts-1.html#distributed-systems-are-a-ux-problem">also UX problems</a>.</p>
