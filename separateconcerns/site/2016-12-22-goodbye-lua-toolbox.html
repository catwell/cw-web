    <p>In November 2013, I gave
<a href="http://files.catwell.info/presentations/2013-11-lua-workshop-lua-ecosystem">a talk</a>
about the Lua Ecosystem at <a href="https://www.lua.org/wshop13.html">Lua Workshop</a>, in
which I mentioned that finding the best module for some job could be hard and
introduced a website I had built to solve that problem.</p>
<p>That website, Lua Toolbox, was inspired by the popular
<a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby Toolbox</a>. It had two major features:
modules classification (&ldquo;labels&rdquo;) and endorsements by users. I had written it
using Leaf Corcoran&rsquo;s relatively new Lua Web framework,
<a href="http://leafo.net/lapis/">Lapis</a>, and Redis as the datastore.</p>
<p><img alt="Lua Toolbox homepage" src="img/lua-toolbox.jpg"/></p>
<p>In August 2014, MoonRocks, one of Leaf&rsquo;s many projects, became the official
website for LuaRocks. It offered many features including user accounts,
manifests and the ability to upload rocks on the Web. We quickly
<a href="https://github.com/catwell/lua-toolbox/issues/18">started to discuss</a>
merging Lua Toolbox into MoonRocks, but it led nowhere at first and the two
websites continued their separate lives.</p>
<p>Eventually, in March 2016, Etiene Dalcol
<a href="https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks-site/pull/86">took up the project</a>.
By September her and Leaf had written the code for labels and &ldquo;follows&rdquo;,
which replace endorsements. They also added a feature for users to convert
their Toolbox endorsements to LuaRocks follows. I sent them a data dump which
they imported into the production LuaRocks website, and I turned Lua Toolbox
read-only.</p>
<p>Today, I finally replaced the whole website by
<a href="https://lua-toolbox.com">a static page</a>
redirecting users to LuaRocks. In the end, the Toolbox had 232 users and
referenced 1217 modules. The source code
<a href="https://github.com/catwell/lua-toolbox">remains available</a> but
I would not advise you to do anything with it (it uses old Lapis APIs, from
a time where plain Lua support was not official).</p>
