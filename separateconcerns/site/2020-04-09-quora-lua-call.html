    <p>From 2011 to 2014, I used to post answers on <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>. I don&rsquo;t anymore, because I don&rsquo;t really like what the website has become. I have a copy of some of my answers <a href="http://files.catwell.info/misc/mirror/quora-answers/">here</a> but someone <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-__call-metamethod-in-Lua-and-what-are-some-of-its-uses-and-basic-examples/all_comments/Pierre-Chapuis?__nsrc__=4&amp;__snid3__=7556751152&amp;comment_id=135057589&amp;comment_type=2">commented</a> on one of my answers that it should be available more prominently on the Web, so I decided to repost a few of my answers here, starting with this one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-__call-metamethod-in-Lua-and-what-are-some-of-its-uses-and-basic-examples/">original question</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really new to lua and relatively new to programming.,so kindly excuse if I say something stupid.</p>
<p>I have a table named x and its metatable named y.
When I have a <code>__call</code> method defined for the metatable <code>y</code>, then I can call <code>x()</code> but if I have a <code>__call</code> for <code>x</code> then I can not call <code>x()</code>.</p>
<p>What is <code>__call</code> used for? How does it work and what are some examples of usage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I answered it on February 25, 2013.</p>
<hr/>
<p><code>__call</code> is a metamethod, that means it is meant to be defined in a
metatable. A <code>__call</code> field added to a regular table (<code>x</code> in your example)
does nothing.</p>
<p>The role of <code>__call</code> is to make something that is not a function (usually
a table) act like a function. There are a few reasons why you may want
to do that. Here are two examples.</p>
<p>The first one is a memoizing factorial function. In Lua you could write
a recursive factorial like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local function fact(n)
    if n == 0 then
        return 1
    else
        return n * fact(n - 1)
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Note: this is not a good way to write a recursive factorial because you
are not taking advantage of tail calls, but it&rsquo;s enough for what I want
to explain.</p>
<p>Now imagine your code uses that function to calculate the factorials of
numbers from 1 to <code>N</code>. This would be very wasteful since you would
calculate the factorial of <code>N</code> once, the factorial of <code>N-1</code> twice, and so
on. You would end up computing approximately <code>NÂ²/2</code> factorials.</p>
<p>Instead you could write that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local fact
fact = setmetatable(
    {[0] = 1},
    {
        __call = function(t, n)
            if not t[n] then
                t[n] = n * fact(n - 1)
            end
            return t[n]
        end
    }
)
</code></pre>
<p>It is an implementation of factorial that memoizes the results it has
already computed, which you can call like a function. You can use it
exactly like the previous implementation of factorial and get linear
complexity.</p>
<p>Another use case for <code>__call</code> is matrices. Imagine you have a matrix
implementation that works like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local methods = {
    get = function(self, i, j)
        return self[i + 1][j + 1]
    end
}

local mt = {__index = methods}

local new_matrix = function(t)
    return setmetatable(t, mt)
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can use it like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local M = new_matrix({ {1, 2}, {3, 4} })
local v = M:get(0, 1)
assert(v == 2)
</code></pre>
<p>However scientists would probably expect something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local v = M(0, 1)
assert(v == 2)
</code></pre>
<p>You can achieve that thanks to <code>__call</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local mt = {
    __index = methods,
    __call = function(self, i, j)
        return self:get(i, j)
    end
}
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this gives you enough information to understand how you can use
<code>__call</code>. A word of warning though: like most other metamethods, it is
useful but it is important not to abuse it. Simple code is better :)</p>
