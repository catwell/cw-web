<p>Clarification: The title is exaggerated. I have never hated LuaJIT, I just went back to using PUC Lua primarily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started using Lua in early 2007. I had already been programming for years, but I had reached a point where I had decided that I wanted to know exactly what was going on when my computer executed dynamic code. That meant understanding two critical pieces of the software stack: the OS and the interpreter.</p>
<p>I already had notions of how an interpreter works and I could tell the main functions of a Unix kernel, but really understanding software, for me, implied reading its source code. I quickly realized that I would not succeed if I started with Perl or Python and Linux, which were what I was using at the time, so I set my sights on Lua and Minix3.</p>
<p>Knowing software also implies using it, so Minix3 and Lua became my main OS and language for several months. To be honest, I was running Minix3 in a VM due to the lack of drivers for my hardware. I started to study their code, with the help of <a href="http://www.minix3.org/doc/#book">the book</a> for Minix3 and resources found online for Lua. I learnt a lot during that period.</p>
<p>Eventually, I went back to Linux for practical reasons, but I had been charmed by the down-to-Earth elegance of Lua. It became my favorite programming language. I was still a student though, so I mostly wrote small utilities, Web pages and game prototypes with it. Coursework was Java, Python and C, and for &ldquo;serious&rdquo; stuff at <a href="http://resel.fr/">ResEl</a> I used Perl, Python or Bash.</p>
<p>Then in 2010 I went to <a href="https://moodstocks.com/">Moodstocks</a> for my MSc Thesis. We were a very tiny startup then, just the founders and a couple of interns. They were a Ruby and C++ shop, so I learnt Ruby, but I didn&rsquo;t like it: too much magic, and the object-oriented interface to write bindings was a mess compared to the very clean Lua C API.</p>
<p>Eventually, Moodstocks hired me and I worked for them for over three years. I ended up writing most of their server-side code, I already gave <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html">details here</a>. A lot of that code leveraged LuaJIT. It was the perfect tool for the job: as flexible and dynamic as Ruby so it worked well as a scripting language, about as fast as C++ so it could be used to implement Computer Vision algorithms, and the FFI made it very easy to call into our existing C / C++ libraries.</p>
<p>Those are the features that make LuaJIT so attractive: its blazing speed and the FFI. They are why I could write Lua professionally for several years, and I could never thank Mike Pall enough for this. Moreover, LuaJIT has been playing a huge role in the growing popularity of Lua those last few years.</p>
<p>However, paradoxically, LuaJIT negates the very reason that made me pick Lua in the first place. And by that I mean: I do not deeply understand how LuaJIT works. I have tried, and I will certainly try again, but it is one or two orders of magnitude more complicated than PUC Lua.</p>
<p>Beyond the purist ideal of understanding the whole stack, this has practical implications. When you find a bug in LuaJIT, understanding it and fixing it is terribly complicated. The best I can do is usually to try to produce a small test case that reproduces the bug (even that is not always easy) and hope Mike Pall finds a fix. With PUC Lua I could probably fix it myself - but of course PUC Lua is so simple that I have never found a bug in it!</p>
<p>Another issue is that PUC Lua and LuaJIT are diverging. LuaJIT implements Lua 5.1. Lua 5.2 code can be made to work as long as it does not use <code>_ENV</code>, but code that leverages the new features in Lua 5.3 is not supported at all (although modules like <a href="https://github.com/keplerproject/lua-compat-5.3">lua-compat-5.3</a> can probably help). On the other hand, more and more modules require the FFI, making them incompatible with PUC Lua (of course <a href="https://github.com/catwell/luajit-msgpack-pure">I am a culprit of that myself</a>). And to top it all, the interpreters work so differently that efficient code in LuaJIT is not necessarily good in PUC Lua, and vice versa.</p>
<p>These days, the purist, simplicity-loving part of me tends to win over the pragmatist in my (rare) non-work code, and my current target of choice is PUC Lua. At work, I write almost exclusively C and almost no Lua, and the little I do write runs on <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2019-02-15-goodbye-lima.html">a machine</a> which does not support LuaJIT. The only reasons I still use LuaJIT are maintenance of luajit-msgpack-pure and my use of OpenResty, which for my purposes could as well be built with PUC Lua instead.</p>
<p>That being said, I like knowing that I could take my Lua code and, with a few tweaks and a change of interpreter, get a serious performance boost. So I still hope someone (if not Mike Pall) will make a version of LuaJIT that supports the Lua 5.3 interface. Otherwise, I guess I can still decide that learning more about JIT compilation is worth it and spend a few months diving into that LuaJIT codebase!</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, with this whole systemd thing, I am semi-seriously considering giving Minix3 a second chance :)</p>
