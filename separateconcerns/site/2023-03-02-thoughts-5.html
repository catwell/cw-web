<section id="What-is-a-good-engineer">
<h2>What is a good engineer?</h2>
<p>When I was a student at <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">IMT Atlantique</a> (back when it was still called Telecom Bretagne) I took an optional class about the history of telecommunication systems. It was mostly taught by retired engineers from the field.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating class. A recurring theme was what an engineer&rsquo;s job was about. One of the teachers, who had been instrumental in the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_switching_system">electronic switching</a> in Europe, said something among those lines: &ldquo;a good engineer delivers systems that are scalable, cheaper, and ship faster&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about that topic lately, and even though I will not deny the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all about trade-offs&rdquo; line I have been using for years, it is good to remember that those trade-offs should be made only on the optimum curve.</p>
<p>Add to that the idea that engineers should know what systems <strong>not</strong> to build, and you have my definition of what makes a good engineer.</p>

<section id="Using-the-word-We">
<h2>Using the word We</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.la-grange.net/karl/">Karl</a> wrote <a href="https://www.la-grange.net/2023/01/23/reveur">something interesting</a> about using the word We to talk about a company or a team. He wrote it in French so here is a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I often see a company&rsquo;s employees use the word We (&ldquo;nous&rdquo; in French). For a very long time I have been trying to avoid using this turn of phrase in my mail, bugs, etc. For instance, at Mozilla, I used to say &ldquo;the Webcompat team&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mozilla&rdquo;, or to change the sentence to focus on the product itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of &ldquo;We should add feature H to solve this bug&rdquo;, I would say &ldquo;Product A needs feature H to solve this bug&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I notice myself unconsciously using &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I correct it immediately. But why? To preserve the emotional distance between work and pseudo-belonging to a company.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rdquo; has a very inclusive meaning of identity for me, and so I avoid it in contractual relationships. The company no longer has a &ldquo;we&rdquo; when the time to reduce its workforce for financial gain comes. It is one of my struggle techniques, a small resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand what he is saying and it makes a lot of sense, yet I make a different choice. In fact, I cannot fathom working for a company or at least a team where I would not feel comfortable saying &ldquo;we&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same uneasy feeling I have when I see people say that small startups branding themselves as family is a red flag. I understand why they would say that. And sure, we are not family, but when you work that closely with people for years, I think there should be some sense of belonging. Maybe &ldquo;friends&rdquo; is a better word.</p>
<p>Also, I am never going to work for a company if I am not aligned with its mission. If I start trying to distance myself from it and notice it, things will have to change one way or another.</p>

<h2>Opportunity Cost</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1631032634779525122">This tweet by Jaana Dogan</a> made me remember <a href="https://erikbern.com/2020/03/10/never-attribute-to-stupidity-that-which-is-adequately-explained-by-opportunity-cost.html">this blog post by Erik Bernhardsson</a>, which I often find to be true, especially when dealing with startups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never attribute to stupidity that which is adequately explained by opportunity cost.</p>

<h2>Theory of Mind</h2>
<p><a href="https://boz.com/articles/theory-mind">A great post by Andrew Bosworth</a> (CTO of Meta) about how some people such as John Carmack can have an influence even after they&rsquo;re gone.</p>

<section id="Chrome-10-years-later">
<h2>Chrome, 10 years later</h2>
<p><a href="https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/12/chrome.html">A long post by Evan Martin</a> about his experience working on Chrome from 2007 to 2012. Toward the end, he turns to the state of Chrome and the Web today.</p>
<p>I love this kind of retrospective post, which are full of anecdotes, deeper insight, and food for thought.</p>
<p>By the way, Evan posts interesting things on a variety of topics. I have been subscribing to his feed for a very long time, I think for Arch-related content initially. You may want to look at his other posts as well.</p>

<h2>Invest in things that don&rsquo;t change</h2>
<p>Here is <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/invest-in-things-that-don-t-change-6f7f19e1">DHH saying something</a> I&rsquo;ve been saying for a very long time as well, but it bears repeating. There is way too much stuff happening to follow it all. If you want to last in this job, especially as a generalist, you must figure out the fundamental things that will matter even more in 10 years than today, and ignore most of the rest unless it&rsquo;s a deliberate strategy.</p>

<section id="CRDTs-Automerge-and-Braid">
<h2>CRDTs, Automerge and Braid</h2>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s not my main focus anymore, I am still following CRDT-based state synchronization systems attentively. Two projects have caught my attention recently. The first one is <a href="https://braid.org">Braid</a> which has been progressing steadily, and the second is Automerge which has announced <a href="https://automerge.org/blog/automerge-2/">a major 2.0 release</a>.</p>
