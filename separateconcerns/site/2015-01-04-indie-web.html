    <p>It is not a secret that I don&rsquo;t like Web technology. I prefer XHTML to HTML5, I think JavaScript is a terrible language, and don&rsquo;t get me started on microformats (let&rsquo;s just say that SoC &gt; DRY&hellip;). I&rsquo;d rather see this mess replaced by something much simpler that <strong>only</strong> deals with linked documents and feeds, and maybe a separate platform for portable applications.</p>
<p>However, the Web is here to last, and given its importance, its centralization is concerning. This is why I am interested in the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">Indie Web</a> movement, which I see as part of the larger effort to decentralize Internet. By the way, if you are into this and live in Paris, check out <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Meetup-pour-la-decentralisation-dInternet/">this meetup</a> which is held every six weeks at Mozilla&rsquo;s office. I have been there every time since its inception and it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have seen today via my feed reader that <a href="http://tantek.com/2014/357/b1/2015-indieweb-site-launch-commitment">some people had made commitments for 2015-01-01</a>. I am a bit late, but I decided to follow suit by adding <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Why_web_sign-in">Web sign-in</a> and <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/h-card">a h-card</a> to <a href="http://catwell.info">my home page</a>. I will probably add <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/h-entry">h-entry</a> markup to this blog later this week, too.</p>
