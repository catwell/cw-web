<p>In two weeks, I will no longer be an <a href="https://inch.fr">Inch</a> employee. I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2020-12-16-personal-news.html#joining-inch">joined the company</a> a bit over three years ago, but it feels like much longer. Back then I had no child, and the first thing the word &quot;Pandemic&quot; brought to mind was a good board game.</p>

<p>Three years later, Inch is not so different from the company I joined, and yet much better in many ways. As for me, I did what I came for initially, and then more. Now I have an opportunity I could not pass. It is too early to talk about it except <a href="https://framapiaf.org/@catwell/109904487542868111">in cryptic form</a>, but when I do you will understand.</p>

<p>So I close this chapter of my professional life, leaving Inch and its team. Which is the hardest part, because they&#39;re a fun and endearing bunch, and we&#39;ve been through those not-so-great years together, and we&#39;ve made so many memories. And now <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-03-02-thoughts-5.html#using-the-word-we">we&#39;re friends</a>. But well, I am not leaving Paris, so it&#39;s not like we won&#39;t see each other again. :)</p>

And by the way, Inch is hiring a software engineer! It is a French-speaking, semi-remote position. Get in touch if you are interested.
