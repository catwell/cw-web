    <p>Over the years, I have accumulated links to blog posts I intend to re-read every time find myself in a position to influence the early stage of a company.</p>
<p>I thought it might be helpful to someone if I published part of that list here. I will avoid links which are too technical and focus on links that can be interest non-technical founders as well.</p>
<p>Note that I haven&rsquo;t included books. There are many good books for founders, but if you must read only one make it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507">The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a>.</p>

<h2>My own posts</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started by mentioning posts from this blog which transcribe the opinions of two influential people, which I share (on those topics).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-03-24-vogels-skills.html">Werner Vogels on Skills</a>, where the CTO of Amazon.com describes the qualities he is looking for in leaders at Amazon, in particular Ownership and the willingness to get their hands dirty doing operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2014-05-28-hacker-founders.html">Hacker Founders</a>, where Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, explains how programmers have an edge as company founders, including as CEOs.</p>

<section id="Titles-are-Toxic">
<h2><a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/titles-are-toxic/">Titles are Toxic</a></h2>
<p>Michael Lopp (Rands) on issues with giving people titles. Personally I have never liked titles, which can be a source of conflicts and bad decisions. I have also often held titles that didn&rsquo;t really correspond to the job I did - which was almost always multi-faceted. Yet, titles are a proxy used by people who don&rsquo;t know you to understand what you do at work.</p>
<p>Like Rands I don&rsquo;t have a good solution to that. I write <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html">some</a> <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2018-01-06-four-years.html">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2021-05-01-inch.html">posts</a> explaining what I do in more details that a title ever could, for people who care.</p>
<p>In any case I always suggest avoiding giving some titles to people too early, including to founders: having a &ldquo;technical co-founder&rdquo; instead of a CTO will make things easier if you grow fast and need to hire someone later on.</p>

<section id="The-40%-rule">
<h2><a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-40-rule/">The 40% rule</a></h2>
<p>A simple but powerful rule of thumb for SaaS companies by Brad Feld, relayed by Fred Wilson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>annual revenue growth rate + operating margin should equal 40%</p>

<h2><a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/compete-on-profit.html">Why it’s nice to compete against a large, profitable company</a></h2>
<p>Jason Cohen explains how a startup can disrupt a large competitor by making a part of their business unprofitable and forcing them to abandon it. It&rsquo;s not as simple as this summary makes it sound, and it&rsquo;s not the Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma. Read the article :)</p>

<section id="Product-design-at-GitHub">
<h2><a href="https://warpspire.com/posts/product-design">Product design at GitHub</a></h2>
<p>Kyle Neath on how, in the early days of GitHub, everyone was a &ldquo;product designer&rdquo;. Many successful SaaS products started with the same concept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only hire smart people we trust to make our product better. We don’t have managers dictating what to work on. We don’t require executive signoff to ship features. Executives, system administrators, developers, and designers concieve, ship, and remove features alike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I think I have never seen a company ship good product fast without doing some version of this.</p>

<h2><a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20211024">Wants, needs, and chasm-crossing</a></h2>
<p>A recent post by Avery Pennarun, Tailscale CEO. It shows how the best strategy to acquire customers is often to solve a single <strong>Want</strong> - something their current solution doesn&rsquo;t provide - and then to resolve all their <strong>Needs</strong> (blockers) so they can actually flock to your product instead of attempting to implement any more <strong>Wants</strong>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://files.catwell.info/misc/mirror/2015-08-17-codemanship-small-teams-manifesto.txt">The Small Teams Manifesto</a></h2>
<p>Jason Gorman says small teams win because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
the probability that a project fails increases rapidly with size;
</li>
<li>
small teams interact more effectively with the customer and/or end users;
</li>
<li>
small teams are easier to build (hiring good people is hard).

</ul>

<section id="Innovating-with-purposeful-anger">
<h2><a href="https://www.icopilots.com/innovation-mindset/innovating-purposeful-anger-12965">Innovating with purposeful anger</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the very interesting tools using anger as a driver to innovate is the “You Got Fired!” game.</p>
<p>Get a bunch of managers in a business unit and role-play that their whole team is fired. Indicate also that as a cockup from legal their non-compete clause isn’t applicable.</p>
<p>Then, give them an hour to build a competitor startup that will take revenge on their company on a “That’ll teach them!” mode.</p>
