<p>Today I attended Lua Workshop, and Roberto Ierusalimschy&#39;s keynote was about <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a>, a language designed as a system counterpart to Lua in a scripting architecture. The language is a typed subset of Lua and can be used to replace C or as an interface between Lua and C. It is still a work in progress, there is no stable release yet.</p>

<p>Pallene works by accessing the internals of the Lua VM, so it requires <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/lua-internals">a patched version of Lua</a>. I wanted to try it so I added support for it to <a href="https://loadk.com">localua</a>. You can just use &quot;pallene&quot; instead of the Lua version and it will pull the latest sources of Pallene and its Lua fork and install them in a self-contained directory.</p>

<p>The Pallene compiler does not have an easy way to specify a local Lua directory and I decided against hacking it so you will have to pass <code>CFLAGS</code> as an environment variable for it to work.</p>

<p>I have just pushed a localua version that supports this so you too can try Pallene now. Be aware that I have only tested this on Linux, and that it is an undocumented feature which means I do not guarantee I will support it forever. That being said, this works now:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">curl &quot;https://loadk.com/localua.sh&quot; -O
chmod +x localua.sh
./localua.sh .lua pallene
curl -O &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pallene-lang/pallene/master/examples/fibonacci/fibonacci.pln&quot;
CFLAGS=&quot;-I $(pwd)/.lua/include -O2&quot; ./.lua/bin/pallenec fibonacci.pln
./.lua/bin/lua -e &#39;print((require &quot;fibonacci&quot;).fibonacci(10)[8])&#39; # prints 13
