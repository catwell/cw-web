<section id="I-want-to-work-on-core-product">
<h2>I want to work on core product</h2>
<p>This means I want to work directly on the product my employer is selling or something that makes it possible. Support functions matter and I have huge respect for them but they are not for me.</p>
<p>My sweet spot is working on B2B products and interacting directly with customers.</p>
</section>
<section id="I-want-to-work-on-AI">
<h2>I want to work on AI</h2>
<p>Historically, my specialty is Distributed Systems, but I happened to work on AI (for Computer Vision) &ldquo;before it was cool.&rdquo; I left the field, re-joined it, and I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2024-10-16-not-leaving-ai.html">intend to stay in it</a> for now.</p>
<p>Note that for me working &ldquo;on AI&rdquo; does not just mean using LLMs through APIs. Typically, it means training and operating models.</p>
</section>
<section id="I-want-to-work-hybrid-remote-in-Paris">
<h2>I want to work hybrid-remote in Paris</h2>
<p>I believe close-knit teams that meet regularly learn to work better together. I know some people believe this can be achieved fully remotely but I do not. However, I also believe working from home part of the time has benefits including cutting down on commute and better focus.</p>
<p>This is not a hard red line, I could go with full remote or full in-office under some conditions. My location is though: my life is in Paris, France and I am not considering relocating anywhere.</p>
</section>
<section id="Fields-I-avoid-favor">
<h2>Fields I avoid / favor</h2>
<p>I <strong>do not</strong> want to work in finance-related fields, including banking and crypto. I would also like to avoid working for HR / recruiting companies.</p>
<p>Fields that specifically interest me include energy and robotics.</p>
</section>
<section id="Management">
<h2>Management</h2>
<p>I am highly autonomous and self-directed. <strong>All</strong> my direct managers so far have been the company founders. I can deal with <strong>some</strong> politics, but not much.</p>
<p>In most cases I prefer being an IC with a <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-02-03-staff-engineer-inch.html">Staff+</a> role. I am fine with having a few skilled IC reports; I do not manage managers.</p>
</section>
<section id="Culture">
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>I recognize the necessity of process, but I highly dislike its abuse.</p>
<p>I think small teams with real ownership work best.</p>
<p>I think people who <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2025-08-24-beliefs.html">care</a> can — sometimes should — disagree and argue passionately, and still remain friends.</p>
