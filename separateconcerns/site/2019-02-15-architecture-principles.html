    <p>This is just a short post to share what I now consider, after 10 years in the industry (and almost twice as many writing code), my core software architecture principles.</p>
<p>You may or may not agree with them all, but if you design software or systems, you should have a similar list in your head; it really helps a lot when making decisions.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concern</a> often trumps not repeating oneself (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>). In other words, avoiding duplication does not justify introducing coupling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall%27s_law">Gall&rsquo;s Law</a>: &ldquo;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a>: &ldquo;Organizations produce designs which are copies of their communication structures.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When writing code or designing, stop and think &ldquo;consequences&rdquo;. What will be the impact of what you are doing on the rest of the systems? Could there be adverse side-effects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about debuggability in production. There is nothing worse than having your software break and not being able to figure out why. Do not automate things you do not understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
