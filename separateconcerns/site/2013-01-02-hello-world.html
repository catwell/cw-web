    <p><a href="http://catwell.info">I</a> have not had a blog for over two years. The main reason for that is that writing is hard, so I went shopping on Twitter instead.</p>
<p>This was a bit hypocrite since I am an advocate for the Open Web and a huge consumer of information feeds, with several hundreds of them in my news reader. So for this New Year I have decided to put an end to this situation, thrown together a few lines of Lua code that act as a static blog generator (because reinventing the wheel is fun), and here it is: my new online journal.</p>
<p>I do not know with what frequency I will publish but expect articles about working at startups, distributed systems, programming in Lua, dealing with mobile networks, and whatever I happen to read and find interesting. Oh, and also the occasional rant, I guess.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s to the tradition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local greet = function(name)
  print(string.format("Hello, %s!",name))
end

greet("World")
</code></pre>
