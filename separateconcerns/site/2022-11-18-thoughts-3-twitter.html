<p>&ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo; are posts that relate to things that have been on my mind recently. Some are practical and some are just reflections on a given topic. They are less thought out than regular posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/pchapuis">the Bird</a>, of course. Not sure if or when it will collapse. Better safe than sorry so I am planning my retreat to <a href="https://framapiaf.org/@catwell">the Pachyderm</a>, but I do not really believe in the Fediverse model.</p>
<p><a href="https://eric.daspet.name">Eric</a> said on Twitter - where he deletes his tweets so I won&rsquo;t link it - that it might be time to bring back RSS/Atom feeds. I agree, especially since I finally found <a href="https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr">a feed reader I like</a>. I know I won&rsquo;t have the discipline to post as frequently as him, <a href="https://www.la-grange.net">Karl</a> or <a href="http://www.landley.net/notes.html">Rob</a>, still that&rsquo;s what those &ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo; posts were supposed to be for initially.</p>
<p>But feeds by themselves are not enough. The value is in the graph and the discovery that comes with it. I follow about 450 feeds, and you cannot see which ones. I won&rsquo;t publish my raw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> though. It&rsquo;s not properly categorized so it wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful anyway. It&rsquo;s like my <a href="https://catwell.info/booklist/">booklist</a>, which I consider deprecating soon: too many items, not enough value.</p>
<p>Maybe the solution is to publish lists of links here from time to time like <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2022/10/16/science-and-technology-links-october-16-2022/">Daniel</a>. You can also follow <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:catwell">my Pinboard</a>, which has feeds. <a href="https://lobste.rs">Lobsters</a> is great too.</p>
<p>Something else feeds don&rsquo;t do is discussion / debate. But maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing; I was growing tired of that aspect of Twitter lately. I think I prefer topic-specific spaces to social networks. I&rsquo;m on a bunch of Slacks, Google Groups and mailing lists already. I liked forums but they&rsquo;re out of fashion.</p>
<p>Oh, and for private messages, well&hellip; just send me an email, I guess.</p>
