    <p>You can only claim to be contrarian if people actually defend the opposite viewpoint. Well, one of the &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-08-06-disagreeing-best-practices.html">disagree with</a> was recently <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/09/use-abstraction-to-improve-function.html">featured in the Google Testing Blog</a> — usually a very good resource, there is a reason that post appeared in my newsreader!</p>
<p>The authors present two versions of a function and ask which one is the most readable.</p>
<p><img alt="createPizza" src="img/linear-code.png"/></p>
<p>At first glance, we can already notice the presentation is a bit partisan :) In addition to the obvious background color bias, the authors ellipsed some code on the right-hand side, making both implementations appear roughly the same size when the right one is really much longer.</p>
<p>The authors argue that the function on the right is more readable because it does not mix levels of abstraction, and that makes it more &ldquo;top-down&rdquo;. Well, OK, but the function of the left reads linearly from the top of the screen to the bottom, whereas if you want to understand everything that happens on the right-hand side you need to jump back and forth.</p>
<p>You may tell me, sure, but you never need to look at the whole code, that is what abstraction is for! OK. Quick, tell me this: does the function that bakes the pizza also heat the oven, or do you need to preheat it first? Hint: there are <strong>two</strong> functions. One is called <code>bake</code> and takes a Pizza, and the other is called <code>bakePizza</code>&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, what happens if you pass a pizza to those functions twice? Are they idempotent or do you end up eating cinder?</p>
<p>So, you may have guessed that I do not like the code style on the right. But I have to admit something: it is somehow easier to understand than the code on the left. Is that because of the structure that separates the levels of abstraction? Let us see. What about that version?</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func createPizza(order *Order) *Pizza {
  // Prepare pizza
  pizza := &amp;Pizza{Base: order.Size,
                  Sauce: order.Sauce,
                  Cheese: “Mozzarella”}

  // Add toppings
  if order.kind == “Veg” {
    pizza.Toppings = vegToppings
  } else if order.kind == “Meat” {
    pizza.Toppings = meatToppings
  }

  oven := oven.New()
  if oven.Temp != cookingTemp {
    // Heat oven
    for (oven.Temp &lt; cookingTemp) {
      time.Sleep(checkOvenInterval)
      oven.Temp = getOvenTemp(oven)
    }
  }

  if !pizza.Baked {
    // Bake pizza
    oven.Insert(pizza)
    time.Sleep(cookTime)
    oven.Remove(pizza)
    pizza.Baked = true
  }

  // Box and slice
  box := box.New()
  pizza.Boxed = box.PutIn(pizza)
  pizza.Sliced = box.SlicePizza(order.Size)
  pizza.Ready = box.Close()

  return pizza
}
</code></pre>
<p>Do you recognize it? This is just the left-hand side function code, with function names from the right-hand side added as comments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but this is my favorite. And it looks like the readability just came from explaining what we did properly here, not from extra abstraction layers and indirection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I stand by what I said earlier: do not extract small functions from linear code, especially if you only use them once. None of the benefits offsets the loss in linearity.</p>
<section id="One-more-thing">
<h2>One more thing</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to mention this or not, but I ended up editing the post because there is something that bothers me with this function, and it is that business with the oven.</p>
<p>First, pre-heating the oven is self-contained and should probably be a method of the oven itself. But beyond that, this code makes no sense: why would you create a whole new oven to make a pizza? In real life, you get an oven <strong>once</strong>, and then you bake a whole lot of pizzas with it, without going through the whole heating cycle.</p>
<p>I know this is a synthetic example but this kind of issue actually occurs in real code and sometimes causes performance issues. It is likely that this code should <strong>take</strong> the oven as a parameter. Providing it is the job of the caller.</p>
<p>(And since you put the pizza in the box, you probably want an interface where you return the box, not the pizza. Oh well.)</p>
