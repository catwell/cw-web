<p>In my last post I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2019-02-15-goodbye-lima.html#what-are-you-going-to-do-next">told you</a> I had plans that I was not ready to talk about yet. Well, the time has come. I am happy to announce that I am now the CTO and co-founder of a startup called <a href="https://www.efounders.com/companies/chilli">Chilli</a>.</p>

<p>Chilli is not a typical startup, it is an <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> project. You may know eFounders as the first startup studio in France, which originated companies such as <a href="https://frontapp.com">Front</a>, <a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> and <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>. The way they usually work is that they identify a problem that needs solving and find founders to tackle it, providing them both support and funding in exchange for equity. When the studio was created, I had doubts about the model, but later on I became <a href="https://twitter.com/pchapuis/status/806463326842712067">quite enthusiastic</a> about it.</p>

<p>Most eFounders companies are Software-as-a-Service businesses, and several of them were born of a need identified in traditional SMBs and SMEs. However, many pivoted to serve a different market, either tech companies or enterprises, and we can see the same pattern in other SaaS companies as well. So we end up with software that doesn&#39;t sell in the market it was originally designed for, and SMBs left on the side of the road with unaddressed digital needs. The reason, we believe, lies with the SaaS-to-SMBs distribution model, and that is the issue Chilli intends to solve.</p>

<p>We are certain that the solution to that problem must involve software. However, we also think technology alone will not be enough; a human touch is necessary, which is why my co-founder and CEO Julien comes from a consulting background. What we will build is a hybrid platform to help leaders identify the pain points in their companies and match them with the best digital tools to solve them. By starting from the customer&#39;s needs, we will work around the distribution cost issues and become the missing link between SaaS vendors and traditional SMBs and SMEs.</p>

<p>For me, this is a new and exciting challenge. Despite having been a very early employee at startups twice, I have never been a founder yet, and it is something I have wanted to do for a while. Moreover, it means I will be doing a lot of Product and Web development again, which will change from the last five years I spent mostly in the world of systems software in C and Lua.</p>

<p>On that note, our Web stack is (typed) Python 3 / Flask and TypeScript / Angular, and I am looking for a full stack developer to join the team. This is a junior to mid position based in Paris, France (no remote); since most of the work is on the frontend experience with Python is not a requirement.
