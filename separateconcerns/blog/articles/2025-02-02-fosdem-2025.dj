I am attending FOSDEM in Brussels for the 13th time physically. This is an event I anticipate every year, where I get to meet old friends and new people, watch interesting talks, and drink some Belgian beer.

This year I spent some time with [Gawen](https://github.com/gawen), [Denis](https://blog.zwindler.fr), [Hisham](https://hisham.hm), my brother François, and a few other current and former colleagues.

Here is a list of talks I saw or intend to see (will be updated after the event):

I also sometimes use the opportunity to write a little code, this year I [fiddled with aiomonitor and async generators in Python](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomonitor/issues/418).
