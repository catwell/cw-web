## What is a good engineer?

When I was a student at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) (back when it was still called Telecom Bretagne) I took an optional class about the history of telecommunication systems. It was mostly taught by retired engineers from the field.

It was a fascinating class. A recurring theme was what an engineer's job was about. One of the teachers, who had been instrumental in the development of [electronic switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_switching_system) in Europe, said something among those lines: "a good engineer delivers systems that are scalable, cheaper, and ship faster".

I have been thinking about that topic lately, and even though I will not deny the "it's all about trade-offs" line I have been using for years, it is good to remember that those trade-offs should be made only on the optimum curve.

Add to that the idea that engineers should know what systems *not* to build, and you have my definition of what makes a good engineer.

## Using the word We

[Karl](https://www.la-grange.net/karl/) wrote [something interesting](https://www.la-grange.net/2023/01/23/reveur) about using the word We to talk about a company or a team. He wrote it in French so here is a rough translation:

> I often see a company's employees use the word We ("nous" in French). For a very long time I have been trying to avoid using this turn of phrase in my mail, bugs, etc. For instance, at Mozilla, I used to say "the Webcompat team" or "Mozilla", or to change the sentence to focus on the product itself.

> Instead of "We should add feature H to solve this bug", I would say "Product A needs feature H to solve this bug".

> When I notice myself unconsciously using "we", I correct it immediately. But why? To preserve the emotional distance between work and pseudo-belonging to a company.

> "We" has a very inclusive meaning of identity for me, and so I avoid it in contractual relationships. The company no longer has a "we" when the time to reduce its workforce for financial gain comes. It is one of my struggle techniques, a small resistance.

I understand what he is saying and it makes a lot of sense, yet I make a different choice. In fact, I cannot fathom working for a company or at least a team where I would not feel comfortable saying "we".

It's the same uneasy feeling I have when I see people say that small startups branding themselves as family is a red flag. I understand why they would say that. And sure, we are not family, but when you work that closely with people for years, I think there should be some sense of belonging. Maybe "friends" is a better word.

Also, I am never going to work for a company if I am not aligned with its mission. If I start trying to distance myself from it and notice it, things will have to change one way or another.

## Opportunity Cost

[This tweet by Jaana Dogan](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1631032634779525122) made me remember [this blog post by Erik Bernhardsson](https://erikbern.com/2020/03/10/never-attribute-to-stupidity-that-which-is-adequately-explained-by-opportunity-cost.html), which I often find to be true, especially when dealing with startups.

> Never attribute to stupidity that which is adequately explained by opportunity cost.

## Theory of Mind

[A great post by Andrew Bosworth](https://boz.com/articles/theory-mind) (CTO of Meta) about how some people such as John Carmack can have an influence even after they're gone.

## Chrome, 10 years later

[A long post by Evan Martin](https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/12/chrome.html) about his experience working on Chrome from 2007 to 2012. Toward the end, he turns to the state of Chrome and the Web today.

I love this kind of retrospective post, which are full of anecdotes, deeper insight, and food for thought.

By the way, Evan posts interesting things on a variety of topics. I have been subscribing to his feed for a very long time, I think for Arch-related content initially. You may want to look at his other posts as well.

## Invest in things that don't change

Here is [DHH saying something](https://world.hey.com/dhh/invest-in-things-that-don-t-change-6f7f19e1) I've been saying for a very long time as well, but it bears repeating. There is way too much stuff happening to follow it all. If you want to last in this job, especially as a generalist, you must figure out the fundamental things that will matter even more in 10 years than today, and ignore most of the rest unless it's a deliberate strategy.

## CRDTs, Automerge and Braid

Even though it's not my main focus anymore, I am still following CRDT-based state synchronization systems attentively. Two projects have caught my attention recently. The first one is [Braid](https://braid.org) which has been progressing steadily, and the second is Automerge which has announced [a major 2.0 release](https://automerge.org/blog/automerge-2/).
