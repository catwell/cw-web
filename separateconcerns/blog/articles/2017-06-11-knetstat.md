% knetstat: checking socket options on Linux

    Linux does not expose options such as SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT to userland. The knetstat module does.

A few weeks ago I was debugging network code, and I needed to check if some
sockets were bound with `SO_REUSEADDR` and/or `SO_REUSEPORT`. I researched how
I could inspect that, and was surprised to find out that the Linux kernel did
not expose those options to userland.

Thankfully, there is
[a kernel module called knetstat](https://github.com/veithen/knetstat)
which lets you do this very easily by adding new files into `procfs`. When I
found it it only supported TCP, but I needed the information for UDP as well so
I [contributed the code](https://github.com/veithen/knetstat/issues/10) to
support it.

If you write networking code on Linux or just run servers, I encourage you to
check it out. It is a nice little tool that can come very handy in some
situations, including when you need to check options like `SO_{RCV,SND}BUF`.
