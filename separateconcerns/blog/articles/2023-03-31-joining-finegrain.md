It's been a week since I [left Inch](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-03-11-leaving-inch.html), and now it is time to disclose what I am up to.

Last Monday [I joined](https://twitter.com/pchapuis/status/1640254206148767745) a very early-stage startup called [Finegrain](https://finegrain.ai). We're working on improving online images using AI with no humans in the loop. The founders of the company are the [Moodstocks](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html) founders Denis and CÃ©dric, so we get to work together again after 10 years.

I won't hide it, I am not an AI specialist. Even though I keep informed on advances in the field, I have read [books](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) and written some deep learning code, I am far from the level required at a company like that.

I do intend to learn more, but it turns out we *may* also need the things I do have experience with, such as building scalable and resilient systems with few resources, designing simple APIs to do complex things, integrating with customers and more generally being a technical jack-of-all-trades at a small company :)

If *you* know about AI though, [we are hiring](https://finegrain.ai/jobs/openings/)!
