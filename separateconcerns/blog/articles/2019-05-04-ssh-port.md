    Here is how to change the SSH port on an Arch Linux server with systemd.

I often change the default SSH port from 22 to something else on servers I run. It kind of is a dangerous operation, especially when the only way you have to connect to that server *is* SSH.

The historical way to do this is editing `sshd_config` and setting the `Port` variable, but with recent versions of Arch Linux and the default configuration, this will *not* work.

The reason is that SSH is configured with systemd socket activation. So what you need to do is run `sudo systemctl edit sshd.socket` and set the contents of the file to:

    [Socket]
    ListenStream=MY_PORT
    Accept=yes

where `MY_PORT` is the port number you want.

I hope this short post will avoid trouble for other people, at least it will be a reminder for me the next time I have to setup an Arch server...
