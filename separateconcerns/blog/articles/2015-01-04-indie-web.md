    I don't like the Web, but it is here and should be decentralized.

It is not a secret that I don't like Web technology. I prefer XHTML to HTML5, I think JavaScript is a terrible language, and don't get me started on microformats (let's just say that SoC > DRY...). I'd rather see this mess replaced by something much simpler that *only* deals with linked documents and feeds, and maybe a separate platform for portable applications.

However, the Web is here to last, and given its importance, its centralization is concerning. This is why I am interested in the [Indie Web](http://indiewebcamp.com/) movement, which I see as part of the larger effort to decentralize Internet. By the way, if you are into this and live in Paris, check out [this meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Meetup-pour-la-decentralisation-dInternet/) which is held every six weeks at Mozilla's office. I have been there every time since its inception and it is well worth it.

Anyway, I have seen today via my feed reader that [some people had made commitments for 2015-01-01](http://tantek.com/2014/357/b1/2015-indieweb-site-launch-commitment). I am a bit late, but I decided to follow suit by adding [Web sign-in](http://indiewebcamp.com/Why_web_sign-in) and [a h-card](http://indiewebcamp.com/h-card) to [my home page](http://catwell.info). I will probably add [h-entry](http://indiewebcamp.com/h-entry) markup to this blog later this week, too.

If you want to do the same, you can use [this handy tool](http://indiewebify.me/) to check everything is working.
