It's been that time of the year, [again](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2025-02-02-fosdem-2025.html). No [Denis](https://blog.zwindler.fr) and no [Hisham](https://hisham.hm) this time, but I still got to spend time with other FOSDEM regulars [Gawen](https://github.com/gawen), [Benoît](https://github.com/benoitc), and [Thijs](https://github.com/tieske). I also met [Corentin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corentinkerisit/), [Sylvain](https://sylvainzimmer.com) and [Mehdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimedjaoui/), and got introduced to [Hugo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-le-picard-phd-693b4117a/).

## A digression about agents

This year I didn't write the list above by hand. I gave the URLs to [an agent](https://ampcode.com) and the format I wanted and told it to make it. It's a detail, but I do things like this many times a day now.

I also had agents work for me over the FOSDEM weekend. They ported a personal web application I have from [a Lua Web server](https://redbean.dev) to [another Lua Web server](https://github.com/luanvil/mote), from [a CSS framework](https://picocss.com) to [another CSS framework](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/), and added end-to-end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/). Oh, and the application is in [Teal](https://teal-language.org) so they wrote the definition files for mote too. All I had to do was describe the task and nudge the agents in the right direction in between talks. If I did not have those agents, I would just never have done all this.

At work, I'm back to training models this week, after a long time working solely on inference. Going from zero to GPUs going brr with nontrivial things like adversarial learning and brand new, (almost) working [experiment tracking](https://github.com/gradio-app/trackio) (because [OpenAI is killing the old one](https://neptune.ai/blog/we-are-joining-openai)) took me roughly a day.

And that was with the *old* agents. I can't wait to see how well [my new minions](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6) do tomorrow.
