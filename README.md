# Catwell's Web

## Description

This is the code behind https://catwell.info and https://separateconcerns.com, i.e. a few Lua scripts that generate static pages.

Most of it was written [in January 2013](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-01-02-hello-world.html), it did not change much since then.

There is probably nothing of interest there, but I also have no reason to keep it private.
