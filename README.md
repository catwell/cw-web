# Catwell's Web

## Description

This is the code behind https://catwell.info and https://separateconcerns.com, i.e. a few Lua scripts that generate static pages.

Most of it [was written in January 2013](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-01-02-hello-world.html). There were two major changes since then: [Gemini support in February 2022](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2022-02-05-gemini.html) and the [switch from Markdown to djot in April 2023](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-04-09-djot.html).
