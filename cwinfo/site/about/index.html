    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hello, my name is <a href="/">Pierre Chapuis</a>. I am a software engineer. I design and write scalable, reliable, durable software systems with low TCO. I live in Paris, France.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy working at startups, on their core product. My main defining trait is what Werner Vogels calls <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-03-24-vogels-skills.html">a strong sense of ownership</a>: the software I write and the systems I design actually matter to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe small teams can achieve a lot. Do not ask me to manage the 10x growth of your engineering team, ask me to find ways to prevent that from happening in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The common thread of my career is working with data storage, replication and synchronization systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have professional experience in the fields of:

    </ul>

    <p>
      I have used various programming languages and tech stacks professionally, and I am not religious about it. For personal projects I use <a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a> (and now <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/tl">Teal</a>) since 2006 and I am part of its community.
