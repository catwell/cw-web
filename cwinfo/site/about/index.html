    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hello, my name is <a href="/">Pierre Chapuis</a>, and some people call me <em>catwell</em>, both online and offline. I live in Paris, France.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer with a <em>T-shaped</em> skill set, which means that I am both a generalist and an expert in a specific field (Distributed Systems and Algorithms). I have a Network Engineering degree from <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">a French Grande École</a> and an MSc in Distributed Systems from <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk">a British University</a>, but my interest for computers and programming started way before that (in 2000, at age 11) thanks to Linux and the Open Source community.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy working at startups, on their core product. My main defining trait is what Werner Vogels calls <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-03-24-vogels-skills.html">a strong sense of ownership</a>: the software I write and the systems I design are important to me, and I will always go the extra mile to make sure they are running well. I never merely implement specifications; I always make choices that take into account the needs of customers and the strategy of the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      From 2010 to 2013, I worked at Moodstocks, a startup specialized in image and object recognition on mobile devices. I was their first long-term employee and worked on <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html">many things</a>. I left in December 2013; Moodstocks was later acquired by Google in July 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since January 2014, I work at a startup called <a href="https://meetlima.com">Lima</a> on <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2018-01-06-four-years.html">a distributed filesystem</a>. I currently lead the core engineering team, and I am the software architecture go to person for the whole company.
    </p>

    <h2>Selected skills</h2>

    <h3>Distributed Systems and Algorithms</h3>

    <p>
      My main field of expertise is writing distributed software, more precisely replicated filesystems and databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      What first got me interested in the topic was <a href="https://www.fdn.fr/actions/confs/internet-libre-ou-minitel-2-0/">a conference talk</a> (in French) by Benjamin Bayart at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_Software_Meeting">Libre Software Meeting</a> 2007, entitled "Free Internet or Minitel 2.0?". I went on to study Network Engineering, and got my MSc in Distributed Systems (at the time called "Grid Computing") in 2010.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Moodstocks, I got to apply those skills to the scaling of the core image search engine, as well as to some Web crawling-related code. Later on, I created <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html#dandelion">a distribution mechanism for image signatures</a>, which ended up being generalized to all kinds of mobile data and sold as a separate service called Winch (see <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/deltheil/winch-build-faster-mobile-apps">those</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jinqian/winch-build-faster-mobile-apps">presentations</a>). I also started to get interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Lima, my main job is <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2018-01-06-four-years.html#distributed-filesystem-synchronization">designing and maintaining a distributed filesystem</a>, which is the core of the product.
    </p>

    <h3>Systems Administration</h3>

    <p>
      I installed my first Linux distribution - Red Hat 6.2 - at age 11, after Windows 98 crashed one too many times. It got me introduced to the world of Open Source software and Unix systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I was a student at IMT Atlantique (then Télécom Bretagne), I joined and became the president of the school's <a href="https://resel.fr">student network association</a>. Think of it as some kind of mini-ISP, providing Internet access to hundreds of students and services such as email and Web hosting to many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Moodstocks, I was responsible for the whole Cloud-based production infrastructure: not only did I write most of the code that was running on those servers, but I was responsible for deploying and maintaining it too. To achieve that, I had to make everything as simple, reliable and automated as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Lima too, we do not have a dedicated operations team. Me and another developer on my team share administration duty.
    </p>

    <p>
      A (non-exhaustive) list of tools and software I have significant experience running in production includes: CentOS and Arch Linux, Bash, Flask / Gunicorn, Postfix, nginx and <a href="https://openresty.org/en/">OpenResty</a>, Redis, <a href="https://beanstalkd.github.io">beanstalkd</a>... I also know the AWS cloud infrastructure stack pretty well, given that we used it at Moodstocks and Lima.
    </p>

    <h3>Research and Development</h3>

    <p>
      I am the kind of person who enjoys reading not only technical blog posts, but research papers as well. I sometimes go as far as implementing them for fun. Of course, having worked in the fields of Computer Vision and Distributed Filesystems, this has also been a significant part of my professional life for the last decade.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, even though I enjoy changing roles from time to time, my idea of the perfect place for me is leading a small R&amp;D team dedicated to finding great ideas from Academia, implementing them, improving on them and applying them to real world problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, I also know to stick to tried and true solutions when they do the job well enough!
    </p>

    <h3>Software and Systems Architecture</h3>

    <p>
      I was almost always more interested in programming in the large than programming in the small. I think more in terms of systems and <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-01-28-algorithms-data-structures-protocols.html">protocols</a> than data structures and algorithms. There is a reason my blog has been, for years, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separate Concerns</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Moodstocks, my focus on scalability made me contribute a lot to the systems architecture and the definition of the various <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2014-09-25-microservices.html">services</a>. At Lima, working on core software - and on replication in particular - had the same effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      In November 2017, my role at Lima changed slightly, and I became the reference for software architecture decisions across the whole company, not only the core team that I am leading. Collaborating with developers who work on software I understand less, with languages and technologies I am sometimes unfamiliar with, is a challenging but nonetheless interesting experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my guiding principles regarding software architecture and design are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Separation of Concern often trumps not repeating oneself (DRY). In other words, avoiding duplication does not justify introducing coupling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gall's Law: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."
      </li>
      <li>
        Conway's Law: "Organizations produce designs which are copies of their communication structures."
      </li>
      <li>
        When writing code or designing, stop and think "consequences". What will be the impact of what you are doing on the rest of the systems? Could there be adverse side-effects?
      </li>
      <li>
        Think about debuggability in production. There is nothing worse than having your software break and not being able to figure out why. Do not automate things you do not understand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.</a>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Understanding user behavior and business metrics</h3>

    <p>
      I am a little bit worried about the current trend of software engineers thinking users are someone else's concern. I get why the job is becoming ultra-specialized those days, but the fact that there is someone with the title "UX designer" on a team does not preclude everyone else from thinking about what they are doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      At IMT Atlantique, I worked for 1.5 years with an HMI research lab (LUSSI) on multi-touch multi-user tabletop interfaces for the military (using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiamondTouch">MERL DiamondTouch</a>). My job was mostly writing code, but I got to work with great HMI experts such as Gilles Coppin and François Legras (who went on to found <a href="http://deev-interaction.com">Deev Interaction</a>). Today, I still like to <a href="https://catwell.info/booklist/">read a few design books</a> to keep up.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Moodstocks, I designed the public API that customers were using to search and index images. I also had the idea for an example application, Moodstocks Notes, which attracted a bit of attention (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/10/moodstocks-notes-is-stickybits-without-the-barcodes/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/2010/12/18/moodstocks/">Mashable</a>)... Most importantly, I started getting very interested in user metrics and how to analyze them. I learned about <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version">AARRR</a> and <a href="https://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/05/video-cohort-analysis-talk-at-google.html">cohort analysis</a> and applied them to various parts of the business. I kept doing that at Lima as well.
    </p>

    <h3>The Lua programming language</h3>

    <p>
      I am not one of those "Language X" programmers. Those days, I write most of my code in C, Lua and Python (in that order), but it has not always been the case. Learning a new programming language does not trouble me; on the contrary, I usually enjoy the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lua does hold a special place in my heart though. I started using it in 2007, because I wanted to learn in depth how a major interpreter works, and the Lua code base was way more tractable than Python. I have discovered a lovely, under-estimated, very cautiously designed language that has way more use cases that one would think.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, I introduced Lua at the two companies I worked for (Moodstocks and Lima), got pretty involved with the community, published a few Open Source <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/catwell">modules</a>, attended and spoke at <a href="https://www.lua.org/community.html#workshop">Lua Workshop</a>, co-hosted the Lua track at <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> twice and co-authored <a href="https://www.d-booker.fr/lua-complet/372-le-guide-de-lua-et-ses-applications.html">a book in French</a>.
