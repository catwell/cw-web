    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hello, my name is <a href="/">Pierre Chapuis</a>, and some people call me <em>catwell</em>, both online and offline. I live in Paris, France.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer with a generalist skill set. I have a Network Engineering degree from <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">a French Grande Ã‰cole</a> and an MSc in Distributed Systems from <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk">a British University</a>, but my interest for computers and programming started way before that (in 2000, at age 11) thanks to Linux and the Open Source community.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy working at startups, on their core product. My main defining trait is what Werner Vogels calls <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-03-24-vogels-skills.html">a strong sense of ownership</a>: the software I write and the systems I design are important to me, and I will always go the extra mile to make sure they are running well. I never merely implement specifications; I always make choices that take into account the needs of customers and the strategy of the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      From April 2010 to December 2013, I worked at Moodstocks, a startup specialized in image and object recognition on mobile devices. I was their first long-term employee and worked on <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2013-06-20-three-years-proprietary-projects.html">many things</a>. I left in December 2013; Moodstocks was later acquired by Google in July 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
      From January 2014 to February 2019, I worked at a startup called Lima on <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2018-01-06-four-years.html">a distributed filesystem</a>. I joined Lima as a developer on the Core Engineering team; I ended up leading it and becoming the software architecture go-to person for the whole company.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Lima closed, I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2019-04-23-spicing-things-up.html">co-founded</a> a startup called Chilli, with the goal of solving SaaS distribution to SMBs and SMEs. It was an <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> project. We closed it in September 2019 for business reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides work, I am involved in a few software-related communities, particularly around the <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua programming language</a>. Less recently, you may have met me through projects aiming to decentralize the Internet, or in the Redis community. I also regularly read and talk about research topics such as distributed algorithms (replication) or homomorphic cryptography.
